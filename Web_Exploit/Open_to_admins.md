This secure website allows users to access the flag only if they are admin and if the time is exactly 1400. https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/32249/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:32249

## Open source data

I have looked over the cookies quite a bit, tried sending fake times but server always sends back its GMT time so may have to wait
for a certain time. Also need to be admin I am assuming you need to edit the cookie but I have been unable to crack the cookies
encoding, I am sure theres a tool to do so I just have not found it yet.
