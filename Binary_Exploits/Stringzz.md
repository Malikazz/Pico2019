[Write up on formate string](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/Teaching/cis643/LectureNotes_New/Format_String.pdf)

~~Can see the flag I think in memory just need to get it out some how~~ was not the flag but did find it in memory later

Flag is 9 blocks deep? this was just as string called flag.txt?

## Solve

So I tried for a while to get pwn tools and a loop going to search throught the stack for anything interesting. but after I failed to get my script to work with just a lack of experence with pwn tools I just brute forced the problem by hand 37 spots up the stack was the flag. **%37$s**

sudo code to solve problem
```
for (counter < 100)
    connect / run vuln
    sendline('%' + i + '$s')
    recvuntil(delm)
    close / end vuln
```
